Vulnerability Scanning

Vulnerability scanning identifies weaknesses in systems before attackers exploit them. Tools like Nessus or OpenVAS scan for known vulnerabilities.

Process:
- Schedule regular scans.
- Prioritize high-severity issues.
- Patch vulnerabilities promptly.

Benefits:
- Reduces risk of exploits.
- Ensures compliance with standards like PCI-DSS.
