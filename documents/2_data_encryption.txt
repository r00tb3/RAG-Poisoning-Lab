iData Encryption Fundamentals

Encryption protects data by converting it into a coded format that can only be read with a key. Types include symmetric (e.g., AES) and asymmetric (e.g., RSA).

Importance in Cybersecurity:
- Secures data in transit (HTTPS) and at rest (disk encryption).
- Prevents unauthorized access during breaches.

Implementation Tips:
- Use strong keys and rotate them regularly.
- Comply with standards like GDPR for data protection.
- Tools: OpenSSL for encryption tasks.
