Firewall Basics

A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming/outgoing traffic based on predetermined security rules.

Types:
- Hardware firewalls for network perimeters.
- Software firewalls for individual devices.

Configuration Best Practices:
- Block unnecessary ports (e.g., close port 80 if not needed).
- Log and alert on suspicious activity.
- Regularly update rules to address new threats.
